<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Electronic Engineering](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/) (THU) since 2021, under the supervision of [Prof. Jian Wang](https://web.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/wangjian1/zh_CN/index.htm).
I am also very fortunate to collaborate with [Prof. Jintao Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0VH0ULYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao).
Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University.

My current research interests and past experience can be summarized as follows:
- 1️⃣ Generative Models: Visual Representation Generation;
- 2️⃣ Low-level Vision: Visual Low-level understanding, Processing, and Enhancement;
- 3️⃣ Wireless Communications: AI for Physical Layer.
